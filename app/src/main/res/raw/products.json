VCS functions *Read & Clear Diagnostics Fault Codes VCS easily read & clear vehicle specific information - manufacturer specific codes, factory codes, and generic fault codes on a particular electrical circuit. Our advice: don't forget to print it out in real time. *Quick Test & Quick Delete (select software) The Quick Test feature allows you to quickly scan all systems in the vehicle, identify controllers with faults and provides immediate access to those systems without having to navigate through multiple menus. Our advice: Don't forget to print it out in real time. *Read Live Data Fault codes & live data is the basics of electronic diagnostics. Experience high-speed response rate of 8-10 frames per second w/ real-time troubleshooting of up to 4 graphs. Diagnose signals for rich or lean conditions with live data retrieval and viewing of modules in digital and analog format. Our advice: Don't forget to print it out in real time. *Component & System level actuations test Perform verification tests to validate the functionality of a particular electrical circuit. This function will bypass time consuming labor to check the workmanship of electronic components such as switches, sensors, relays, & actuators. Use the VCS to actuate control modules and see what needs replacement without removing panels and testing without the usage of a multimeter. {cylinder power balance test, EVAP system leak, EGR valve, solenoids, power windows, winshield wiper activation, etc.} Special Functions *Service Resets & Initialization: When components (e.g. injectors, switches, mass air flow sensor, cooling temp sensor, etc.) are replaced within a module, avehicle will run very rough. Initialization immediately readapts all the values,so the components will be recognized by the vehicle system. (e.g. To reset the service indicator for the vehicle such as \"oil service\", \"service reminder light\", \"steering angle sensor\", etc.) *Vehicle Adjustment: Vehicle Communication Scanner VCS is able to adjust performance parameters. (e.g. idle RPM, idle speed adjustment, ignition timing, vehicle w/ immobilizer, set fuel synchronization, throttle-body relearn, DME Alignment, etc.) *Coding & Programming: Read & change coding has now become highly important for any new retrofit control unit in the vehicle. Contact VCS Dealer for more information.
